## This script queries American Community Survey data for a user-defined metro area and
## produces a table with pre-selected vulnerability indicators. You can change the metro
## area to your own community to download the data and export it for use in the shiny app.
## This script assumes you will download regional data and also a "core" city for that 
## region. Make sure you adjust the `primary_place` variable if you seek an alternate city
## within a region.
